            There were only two ways to get out of this mess if they all worked
            together. The problem was that neither was all that appealing. One
            would likely cause everyone a huge amount of physical pain while the
            other would likely end up with everyone in jail. In Sam's mind,
            there was only one thing to do. He threw everyone else under the bus
            and he secretly sprinted away leaving the others to take the fall
            without him. The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could
            remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a
            date they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there
            and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was
            a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all
            thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So,
            the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but
            perfectly normal in another. Things aren't going well at all with
            mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the
            time. I sure hope that things get better soon. Dragons don't exist
            they said. They are the stuff of legend and people's imagination.
            Greg would have agreed with this assessment without a second thought
            24 hours ago. But now that there was a dragon staring directly into
            his eyes, he questioned everything that he had been told. They
            argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's
            always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the
            circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the
            same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or
            strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.
            All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult
            request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn't seem
            to want to honor the request. It might have had something to do with
            the gun pointed at his face. “Ingredients for life,” said the
            backside of the truck. They mean food, but really food is only 1
            ingredient of life. Life has so many more ingredients such as pain,
            happiness, laughter, joy, tears, and smiles. Life also has hard
            work, easy play, sleepless nights, and sunbathing by the ocean.
            Love, hatred, envy, self-assurance, and fear could be just down
            aisle 3 ready to be bought when needed. How I wish I could pull
            ingredients like these off shelves in a store. He read about a hike
            called the incline in the guidebook. It said it was a strenuous hike
            and to bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds”
            described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another.
            “Not too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d
            hike it when I fly in from Maryland on my day off from the senior
            citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the
            neighborhood so I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish
            mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. The chair sat in the
            corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was
            there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since
            someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. Yet there was
            no denying the presence in the chair now. You know that tingly
            feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that
            feeling when talking with her. You know I don't believe in sixth
            senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how
            I know, but I just do. "It was so great to hear from you today and
            it was such weird timing," he said. "This is going to sound funny
            and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of
            days ago. I'd love to get together and tell you about it if you're
            up for a cup of coffee," he continued, laying the trap he'd been
            planning for years. The river slowly meandered through the open
            space. It had hidden secrets that it didn't want to reveal. It had a
            well-planned strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing.
            That's how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water's
            edge. He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent
            from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What
            he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This
            would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable
            consequences, but he wasn't. The headache wouldn't go away. She's
            taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in
            her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in
            her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening. He
            slowly poured the drink over a large chunk of ice he has especially
            chiseled off a larger block. He didn't particularly like his drinks
            cold, but he knew that the drama of chiseling the ice and then
            pouring a drink over it looked far more impressive than how he
            actually liked it. It was all about image and he'd managed to
            perfect the image that he wanted to project. They had always called
            it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river
            likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it
            was and had always been the green river. So it was with great
            surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.
            You're going to make a choice today that will have a direct impact
            on where you are five years from now. The truth is, you'll make
            choice like that every day of your life. The problem is that on most
            days, you won't know the choice you make will have such a huge
            impact on your life in the future. So if you want to end up in a
            certain place in the future, you need to be careful of the choices
            you make today. Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill,
            only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and
            Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went
            through his mental list of the most important papers and documents
            that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having
            prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered
            everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear
            with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen. He swung back
            the fishing pole and cast the line which ell 25 feet away into the
            river. The lure landed in the perfect spot and he was sure he would
            soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite would come from
            behind in the form of a bear. Then came the night of the first
            falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over
            Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.
            Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling
            star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east
            of him. After hunting for several hours, we finally saw a large seal
            sunning itself on a flat rock. I took one of the wooden clubs while
            Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up behind the seal until
            we were close enough to club it over its head. The seal slumped over
            and died. This seal would help us survive. We could eat the meat and
            fat. The fat could be burned in a shell for light and the fur could
            be used to make a blanket. We declared our first day of hunting a
            great success. One can cook on and with an open fire. These are some
            of the ways to cook with fire outside. Cooking meat using a spit is
            a great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from burning,
            it's best to slowly rotate it. Hot stones can be used to toast
            bread. Coals are hot and can bring things to a boil quickly. If one
            is very adventurous, one can make a hole in the ground, fill it with
            coals and place foil-covered meat, veggies, and potatoes into the
            coals, and cover all of it with dirt. In a short period of time, the
            food will be baked. Campfire cooking can be done in many ways. There
            was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed
            for work, but it didn't matter. He was late and if he didn't make
            this meeting on time, someone's life may be in danger. "It doesn't
            take much to touch someone's heart," Daisy said with a smile on her
            face. "It's often just the little things you do that can change a
            person's day for the better." Daisy truly believed this to be the
            way the world worked, but she didn't understand that she was merely
            a robot that had been programmed to believe this. The headphones
            were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom
            yelling in the background, but couldn't make out exactly what the
            yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She
            knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could
            pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling. Barbara
            had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes. it had been twenty
            long and excruciating minutes. David had promised that he would be
            on time today. He never was, but he had promised this one time. She
            had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week
            until she'd believed his promise. Now she was paying the price. She
            was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get
            someplace, but a frantic hurry. The type of hurry where a few
            seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring
            speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes
            away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead. I
            don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I used to be allergic to
            them and I would get stuffed up and have hives. That doesn’t seem to
            happen anymore. But I still don’t like them. I lived with 3 cats
            that were not good at peeing in the litter box. They seemed to find
            something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed
            on photographs or papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas
            into the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats
            and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don’t like cats.
